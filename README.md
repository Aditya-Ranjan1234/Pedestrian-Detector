# Pedestrian Detector

## Project Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly pedestrian detection system that utilizes OpenCV and the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) algorithm. It serves as a practical introduction to image processing and machine learning concepts for those starting their journey in computer vision.

## Features
- Detects pedestrians in images using HOG and SVM.
- Real-Time Camera Pedestrian Tracking

## Sample Images
Here are some examples of the images processed by the pedestrian detector:

### Input Images
![Image 1](Images/img1.jpg)
![Image 2](Images/img2.jpg)
![Image 3](Images/img3.jpg)

### Detected Images
![Detected 1](Images/detect1.png)
![Detected 2](Images/detect2.png)
![Detected 3](Images/detect3.png)
