# Pedestrian Detector

## Project Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly pedestrian detection system that utilizes OpenCV and the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) algorithm. It serves as a practical introduction to image processing and machine learning concepts for those starting their journey in computer vision.

## Features
- Detects pedestrians in images using HOG and SVM.
- Real-Time Camera Pedestrian Tracking

## Sample Images
Here are some examples of the images processed by the pedestrian detector:

### Input Images
<img src="Images/img1.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="300" height="200">
<img src="Images/img2.jpg" alt="Image 2" width="300" height="200">
<img src="Images/img3.jpg" alt="Image 3" width="300" height="200">

### Detected Images
<img src="Images/detect1.png" alt="Detected 1" width="300" height="200">
<img src="Images/detect2.png" alt="Detected 2" width="300" height="200">
<img src="Images/detect3.png" alt="Detected 3" width="300" height="200">
